## Sample GitHub Pages Website

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kevenson/RobotTracking/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever I commit to this repository, whether on my local machine or by editing files directly on GitHub, GitHub Pages will automatically run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content in the associated Markdown files.
